# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Static type checking with mypy: configured in `pyproject.toml` with `disallow_untyped_defs`, `warn_return_any`, and other strict settings; runs via `make typecheck`.
- `py.typed` PEP 561 marker file so downstream consumers can use groster's type annotations.
- `pandas-stubs` dev dependency for accurate pandas type information.
- Type checker step in CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Cached-fingerprint fallback for characters with hidden Blizzard profiles: hidden characters retain their previous alt grouping when the API returns empty data.
- `fingerprint_source` column in achievements summary CSV (`api` or `cache`).

### Changed

- `_classify_fetch_results()` return type annotation corrected from 5-tuple to 6-tuple to match actual return value.
- `register_commands()` in `discord.py` now has an explicit `-> dict[str, Any]` return type.
- Architecture docs updated to describe the multi-factor main-selection scoring model.
- Three `pd.Series.to_dict()` call sites in `CsvRosterRepository` wrapped with `cast(dict[int, str], ...)` to satisfy pandas-stubs.
- `_find_main_in_group()` now uses a weighted multi-factor scoring model (`MAIN_SCORE_WEIGHTS`) combining Level 10 timestamp, character ID, achievement points, and achievement count instead of relying solely on the Level 10 timestamp. Groups where no character has a timestamp now receive a meaningful ranking rather than alphabetical fallback. Ties are broken by lexicographically smallest name for deterministic output.
- `BlizzardAPIClient._request()` now raises `BlizzardAPIError` on retry exhaustion and non-retryable HTTP failures. Service helpers and `_get_roster_details()` handle that path explicitly instead of treating API errors as valid empty payloads.

### Fixed

- Silent `{}` returns from failed Blizzard API requests no longer mask HTTP errors or produce partial data without a visible failure path.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Incremental roster updates: `groster update` now diffs the current guild roster against the previous run and only re-fetches achievement, pet, and mount data for new or changed members, reducing Blizzard API calls by ~75% on typical runs. Member profiles (ilvl, last login) are always refreshed to keep Discord data current.
- `--force` flag on the `update` command to bypass the incremental cache and perform a full refresh.
- `diff_roster_members()` pure function for comparing current Blizzard roster members against previously saved records.
- `get_roster_details()`, `save_character_achievements()`, and `get_member_fingerprints()` methods on `RosterRepository` for incremental state persistence.
- Per-character `achievements.json` cache files under `data/{region}/{realm}/{charname}/` for fingerprint reuse across runs.
- `/alts` slash command that displays every guild main with their alt count in an ephemeral Discord embed, sorted by alt count descending.
- `format_alts_embed()` helper that builds a Discord embed dict with automatic truncation at the 4096-character description limit.
- `get_alts_per_main()` method on `RosterRepository` for per-main alt count aggregation from the dashboard.
- Discord autocomplete for the `/whois` command — typing a partial name shows matching character suggestions.
- Fuzzy "Did you mean?" suggestions when `/whois` finds no exact match, powered by `difflib.get_close_matches()`.
- `search_character_names()` method on `RosterRepository` for prefix-based character name lookup.
- `build_dashboard()` and `get_alt_summary()` methods on `RosterRepository`.
- `InMemoryRosterRepository` with async test support via `pytest-asyncio`.
- Agentic framework: agent modes, coding instructions, prompts, and workflow skills.

### Changed

- `identify_alts()` returns a 5-tuple (was 4-tuple) — the new fifth element is `fingerprint_cache` containing only freshly fetched fingerprint data for persistence.
- `fetch_roster_details()` accepts an optional `cached_records` keyword argument to skip API calls for unchanged members.
- `_get_roster_details()` in `commands/roster.py` returns `(roster_data, cached_profile_records)` to thread incremental state through the orchestration layer.
- `register_commands()` switched from single POST to bulk PUT (`PUT .../commands`) so all guild slash commands are registered atomically.
- `/whois` command handler extracted into `_handle_whois()` helper to reduce `interactions_handler()` complexity.
- `_format_no_character_message()` accepts optional `suggestions` parameter for fuzzy match results.
- Dashboard generation and alt summary logic moved behind `RosterRepository`; `summary_report()` accepts a repository instance instead of reading CSVs directly.
- Dependabot schedule changed from daily to weekly with labels.

### Fixed

- `US/Eastern` timezone in tests replaced with IANA canonical `America/New_York`.

- Refactored `build_profile_links` to use locale mapping.
- Refactored character message formatting for clarity.
- Replaced `print()` calls in `summary_report` with `logging`.
- Reduced logging verbosity across multiple modules.
- Updated architecture diagram for accuracy.
- Bumped pandas to 3.0.x, pytest to 9.0.x, and other dependencies.
